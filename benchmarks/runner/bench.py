"""silver-bench runner. Drives the N(model) x M(tool) matrix over the 30-task set through OpenCode,
capturing per-run transcript + final screenshot + metadata. Resumable, timeouts, health checks.

FULL PER-RUN ISOLATION: every run executes on a fresh CLONE of a golden simulator (sim_device.py),
behind a host-wide single-device lock, with all bench processes killed-and-verified at both ends of
the run and server-side app state reset by per-app hooks (isolation.py). Nothing survives a run:
not the device, not the MCP servers, not the proxies. See docs/surfaces/golden-simulator.md.

Usage:
  python3 bench.py --list                       # show cells/tasks
  python3 bench.py --cell silver:argent --task bsky-01   # single run
  python3 bench.py --cell silver:argent         # one whole cell (all tasks)
  python3 bench.py --all                         # full matrix (resumable; skips completed)
  python3 bench.py --all --apps bluesky,element  # restrict to some apps
  python3 bench.py --verify-golden               # one throwaway clone, launch each app, screenshot
