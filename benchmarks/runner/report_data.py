"""Facts-only exporter for the report front end.

Reads `results/` + `tasks/tasks.json` and writes the static JSON the Vite/Preact pages consume, plus the
run screenshots. The output contract is `web/src/shared/contract.ts` — field names and shapes here are
that file, not this file's own invention.

    python3 runner/report_data.py --results results --out public

Emits, under --out:

    data/v1/run-index.json                       RunIndex: catalog + one RunCell per model x tool x task
    data/v1/runs/<model>__<tool>__<task>.json    RunDetail, one per run that exists on disk
    data/v1/transcripts/<key>.json               RunTranscript, only where the run recorded events
    data/v1/report-meta.json                     ReportMeta
    data/v1/inventory.json                       {"paths": [...]}, every path this export owns
    artifacts/<model>__<tool>__<task>.webp        final screenshots (naming as docs/reporting.md)

NO AGGREGATES. Every number the report renders is derived by deriveReportView() in TypeScript; a second
aggregation implementation living here is the exact thing this migration exists to delete.

Four invariants this file is structured around:

1. The public gate runs before anything is written. `gather()` is the only constructor of a Dataset and
   it applies REPORT_APPS + shown_models + REPORT_MODELS itself; `export()` accepts nothing but a
   Dataset. A model that does not survive the gate has no route to a byte of output — no id, no cell, no
   file, no screenshot. `_assert_gated` re-checks the emitted path set, because a leaked screenshot is a
   path rather than a content match.
2. Only whitelisted meta/score keys are ever read (META_FIELDS / SCORE_FIELDS / JUDGE_INPUT_FIELDS). The
   raw dicts are projected through the whitelist at load time, so `stderr_tail` and `judge_prompt` are
   not merely unused downstream — they are not in memory. `env.json` is never opened at all.
3. Redaction is applied by the single writer, to every resource, rather than per call site.
4. Both exporter-owned trees are pruned to the computed path set, so a run that stops being eligible
   loses its JSON *and* its screenshot instead of staying deployed forever.

No `<script>` escaping happens here: nothing this exporter writes becomes markup. That obligation lives
in serializeInlineJson() on the Node side, at the one boundary where a payload is pasted into HTML.

Branch note: this module must stay byte-identical between the public and internal branches, exactly as
report.py does. Only the `bench_models` import and the BENCH_PUBLIC env var may differ. No
branch-conditional code.
