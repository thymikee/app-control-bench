    The PATH shims in none_shim_dir() scope `xcrun simctl` to the run's own clone, but a shim only
    shadows a *command name* - and the baseline agent has a full shell. Simulators are just
    directories owned by the same user, so `rm`, `mv`, `python` walk straight around it. On
    2026-07-13 a none agent did exactly that: it reached into ANOTHER device's app container with
    `rm -rf .../Devices/<other-udid>/data/Containers/...`, and between that and the crash handler's
    `killall -9 CoreSimulatorService` **every simulator on the host was destroyed**, both goldens
    included (docs/surfaces/golden-simulator.md). Nothing in the shim layer can prevent that; only a
    kernel-enforced boundary can.

    So: deny the agent WRITES to the device set (except its own clone) and to the backups that are
    the recovery path. Everything else is untouched - the baseline's advertised surface is unchanged,
    it still gets a shell, xcrun, xcodebuild and simctl against its own device.

    `simctl` keeps working on the clone because the writes are performed by CoreSimulatorService over
    XPC, not by the agent process, and the service is outside this sandbox.

    Reads stay allowed on purpose: the point is to stop destruction, not to hide the host. And
    `results/` is deliberately NOT denied - the agent's stdout IS the run transcript, which lives
    there, so denying it would break the harness's own capture.

    No-ops (returns cmd unchanged) if sandbox-exec is missing, so a non-macOS host still runs.

def none_shim_dir(udid=None):
    """A PATH dir of shims for the `none` baseline. Two jobs, both about keeping the baseline's reach
    equal to one device:

    1. BLOCK host-level GUI automation. Left to itself the bare no-tool agent bootstraps taps by driving
       the HOST mouse and keyboard (`osascript` -> System Events / CGEvent), which is both a side effect
       outside the device under test and too flaky to run unattended. Shadowing these on PATH makes them
       fail fast, so perception/action is confined to the device-scoped native tooling (simctl/xcrun/
       xctest) the preamble enumerates. The Python Quartz/CGEvent host-synth path is separately closed
       (no pyobjc installed).

    2. SCOPE `xcrun simctl` to this run's own clone (when `udid` is given). simctl is deliberately part of
       the baseline's surface, but it targets ANY device on the host, and `simctl list` shows the agent the
       golden by name. An agent that boots the golden and launches the app on it rotates the golden's frozen
       Bluesky refreshJwt out of band, and every later clone then starts LOGGED OUT — silently zeroing the
       rest of the matrix. It also trips the harness's own one-device-at-a-time guard, aborting run_matrix.
       Both happened (haiku_low/none/bsky-07 booted the golden; see docs/harness.md). The shim rejects any
       simctl arg naming a device other than this run's clone, and the device-lifecycle subcommands
       (create/clone/delete/erase/...) outright — none of which the preamble offers anyway, so the
       advertised baseline surface is unchanged. Everything else execs the real xcrun untouched.
