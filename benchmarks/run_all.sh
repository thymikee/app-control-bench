# One command that runs EVERY missing benchmark run on its own, using the API keys already in the
# opencode auth store. Portable: no per-machine constant editing — paths are auto-detected (override
# with env). Resumable + self-healing: it resets phantom-masked ledger entries first, so a purged
# result can never be silently skipped.
#
# FULLY ISOLATED: each run clones the golden simulator (configs/golden.json — build it once with
# tasks/setup/golden/make_golden.sh), and a host-wide lock allows exactly ONE stream at a time; a
# second invocation fails loudly. There is no UDID knob any more — the device is a per-run clone.
