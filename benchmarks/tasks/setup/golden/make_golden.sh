# make_golden.sh — build + maintain the "golden" benchmark simulator (see README.md).
#
# The golden is a fully-provisioned, logged-in iOS simulator that is NEVER run by
# the benchmark itself: every run clones it (byte-identical data container) and the
# clone is deleted afterwards. This script guides the operator through creating,
# validating, and versioning that golden on the bench Mac ("radoniusz").
#
#   ./make_golden.sh create <device-type> <runtime>   # fresh staging sim + checklist
#   ./make_golden.sh from-existing <udid-or-name>     # clone an already-logged-in sim
#   ./make_golden.sh finalize [vN]                    # smoke-test + rename staging -> bench-golden-vN
#   ./make_golden.sh refresh-check                    # is the current golden safely Shutdown?
#
# Safety contract:
#   - refuses to run while any bench-golden-* simulator is Booted (except the ones a
#     subcommand itself manages) — a Booted golden means a bench may be mid-clone.
#   - only ever touches simulators named bench-golden-staging / bench-golden-v* /
#     bench-golden-smoketest, plus the explicit source of `from-existing`.
#   - on a SHARED dev machine, simulator creation must go through the device
#     allocator instead — this script is for the dedicated bench host only.

Staging simulator is booted. Provision it BY HAND now (one time, ~30 min):

  0. BEFORE launching Bluesky, silence the Expo dev-menu onboarding sheet — it covers
     the app, and it is AX-opaque, so argent's taps cannot dismiss it:

       xcrun simctl spawn <udid> defaults write xyz.blueskyweb.app \
         EXDevMenuIsOnboardingFinished -bool YES

     Write it through `simctl spawn defaults`, NOT by editing the plist: the sim's
     cfprefsd caches the domain and overwrites a file edit.

  1. Install + log in each enabled app, per its tasks/setup/<app>/README.md:
       - Bluesky  (xyz.blueskyweb.app)      — sign in with the bench account; tap
         "Open" once on the "Open in Bluesky?" deep-link dialog so it never reappears
       - Element  (im.vector.app)           — log in as @alice; on the "Verify this
         device" screen do the one-time "Reset everything" flow (README caveat)
       - IceCubes (com.example.IceCubesApp) — log in to the local Mastodon (:3000)
         as the bench account
  2. Dismiss every one-time iOS dialog (keyboard tips, notification prompts, ...)
     so no run ever hits a first-launch modal.
  3. Run ONE throwaway agent-device session against this simulator so the XCTest
     automation runner gets installed into the sim (clones inherit it).
  4. Leave every app on a neutral screen (home feed), then:

       ./make_golden.sh finalize
